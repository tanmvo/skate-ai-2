# PRD: Document Collaboration Feature

## Overview
Add AI-powered document creation and collaborative editing capabilities, complementing our existing document analysis features. Enable researchers to create new documents (reports, summaries, analyses) through AI collaboration.

**Confidence Score: 85%** - Strong technical foundation, clear differentiation from existing features

## Problem Statement
Skate AI currently excels at analyzing uploaded documents but lacks the ability to help researchers CREATE new documents. Researchers need to generate reports, summaries, and analytical documents based on their research but must switch to external tools.

## Solution Architecture

### Core Concept: Complementary Design
**Existing**: Upload docs → Analyze → Discuss  
**New**: Research insights → AI creates → Collaborative editing

### Technical Implementation
Based on Vercel's "Artifacts" system with research-focused adaptations:

```prisma
model CreatedDocument {
  id          String    @id @default(cuid())
  title       String
  content     String    @db.Text
  kind        DocumentKind
  studyId     String
  study       Study     @relation(fields: [studyId], references: [id])
  createdAt   DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime  @updatedAt
  
  suggestions Suggestion[]
}

enum DocumentKind {
  RESEARCH_REPORT
  EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY  
  INTERVIEW_ANALYSIS
  FINDINGS_DOCUMENT
  CODE_SNIPPET
  DATA_VISUALIZATION
}
```

### AI SDK Tools Integration
```typescript
createDocument: {
  description: 'Create a new research document based on analyzed data',
  parameters: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    kind: z.enum(['research-report', 'summary', 'analysis']),
    basedOnDocuments: z.array(z.string()).optional()
  }),
  execute: async ({ title, kind, basedOnDocuments }) => {
    // Generate content using study context and referenced documents
  }
}

updateDocument: {
  description: 'Update existing document with new insights',
  parameters: z.object({
    id: z.string(),
    changes: z.string(),
    section: z.string().optional()
  })
}
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (2-3 weeks)
- Extend database schema for CreatedDocument model
- Add document creation AI tools to existing setup
- Basic UI for displaying created documents in study dashboard
- Simple text document creation and editing

**Key Deliverables:**
- Database migrations and schema updates
- AI tool definitions and testing
- Basic document creation flow in chat
- Document viewing and basic editing UI

### Phase 2: Enhanced Creation (2-3 weeks)
- Multiple document types (reports, summaries, analyses)
- Real-time streaming updates during document creation
- Document versioning and edit history
- Integration with existing study context and uploaded documents

**Key Deliverables:**
- Research-specific document templates
- Streaming document creation UI
- Version control system for documents
- Cross-reference system (analysis docs ↔ created docs)

### Phase 3: Advanced Collaboration (3-4 weeks)
- Suggestion system for collaborative editing
- Document export in multiple formats (Markdown, PDF, DOCX)
- Advanced document templates and presets
- Document-to-document relationships and citations

**Key Deliverables:**
- Collaborative editing interface
- Export functionality
- Document relationship mapping
- Advanced search across created documents

### Phase 4: Polish & Integration (1-2 weeks)
- Performance optimization for large documents
- Advanced UI/UX improvements
- Comprehensive testing and error handling
- User onboarding and documentation

## Integration with Existing Features

### Study Dashboard Enhancement
```typescript
interface EnhancedStudy {
  // Existing document analysis
  uploadedDocuments: Document[]
  
  // New document creation  
  createdDocuments: CreatedDocument[]
  
  // Unified chat supporting both modes
  messages: ChatMessage[]
}
```

### Chat Interface Evolution
- **Analysis Mode**: "Find quotes about user frustration"
- **Creation Mode**: "Create an executive summary of key findings"
- **Hybrid Mode**: "Write a report comparing themes from interviews 1-3"

### UI Integration Points
1. Study dashboard shows both uploaded and created documents
2. Chat interface includes creation tools alongside search tools
3. Document viewer supports both analysis and editing modes
4. Export system handles both insights and created content

## Key Differentiators

### vs. Existing Document Analysis
| Aspect | Current (Analysis) | New (Creation) |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| **User Intent** | "Help me understand" | "Help me create" |
| **AI Role** | Retrieval + Synthesis | Generative + Collaborative |
| **Output** | Chat insights + citations | Persistent documents |
| **Workflow** | Upload → Analyze → Discuss | Research → Generate → Edit |

### Research-Specific Features
- **Study Context Integration**: Created documents automatically reference study materials
- **Citation System**: Generated documents include proper citations to source materials
- **Research Templates**: Pre-built templates for common research deliverables
- **Multi-Document Analysis**: Create documents that synthesize across multiple sources

## Success Metrics
- 30% of active studies include at least one created document
- Average 3 documents created per research study
- 85% user satisfaction with generated document quality
- 70% of created documents exported or shared
- No performance degradation of existing analysis features

## Risk Assessment

### High Confidence Areas (90%+)
- AI SDK v4.3.19 tool integration (proven with existing search tools)
- Database schema extension (straightforward Prisma updates)
- Basic document creation and display
- Integration with existing study context

### Medium Confidence Areas (70-85%)
- Real-time collaborative editing complexity
- Advanced document export formats (PDF generation)
- Performance with large documents and multiple concurrent edits
- User adoption of creation vs. analysis workflows

### Low Confidence Areas (60-70%)
- Advanced suggestion and review system
- Complex document relationship management
- Integration with external document editing tools

### Mitigation Strategies
- Start with Phase 1 minimal viable implementation
- Feature flag for gradual rollout to subset of users
- Performance monitoring and optimization from day 1
- User research to validate creation vs. analysis workflow balance

## Technical Dependencies
- **AI SDK v4.3.19**: Already integrated ✅
- **Prisma ORM**: Extend existing schema ✅
- **React/TypeScript**: Leverage existing component patterns ✅
- **New Dependencies**: 
  - `uuid` for document ID generation
  - PDF export library (TBD based on requirements)
  - Rich text editor (consider Tiptap or similar)

## Future Enhancements
- Real-time collaborative editing with multiple users
- Integration with external tools (Google Docs, Notion)
- Advanced document templates marketplace
- AI-powered document review and improvement suggestions
- Version control with branching and merging

## User Research Questions
- Do researchers prefer in-app document creation or external tool integration?
- What types of research documents are most commonly created?
- How important is real-time collaboration vs. asynchronous editing?
- What export formats are most critical for research workflows?

## Conclusion
Document collaboration represents a natural evolution of Skate AI from a document analysis tool to a comprehensive research platform. The high confidence score reflects strong architectural alignment and proven AI SDK patterns, while the phased approach minimizes risk and enables iterative user feedback.
