### Stripe Integration Architecture

#### 1. Customer & Subscription Management
```typescript
// lib/stripe/customer.ts
export class StripeCustomerManager {
  async createCustomer(user: User): Promise<Stripe.Customer> {
    return await stripe.customers.create({
      email: user.email,
      name: user.name,
      metadata: {
        userId: user.id,
        source: 'skate-ai'
      }
    });
  }

  async createSubscription(
    customerId: string, 
    priceId: string,
    tier: SubscriptionTier
  ): Promise<Stripe.Subscription> {
    return await stripe.subscriptions.create({
      customer: customerId,
      items: [{ price: priceId }],
      payment_behavior: 'default_incomplete',
      payment_settings: { save_default_payment_method: 'on_subscription' },
      expand: ['latest_invoice.payment_intent'],
      metadata: {
        tier: tier,
        platform: 'skate-ai'
      }
    });
  }
}
```

#### 2. Usage-Based Billing Implementation
```typescript
// lib/stripe/usage-billing.ts
export class UsageBillingManager {
  async recordUsage(
    subscriptionId: string,
    eventType: UsageEventType,
    quantity: number
  ): Promise<void> {
    // Record in database for analytics
    await prisma.usageRecord.create({
      data: {
        subscriptionId,
        eventType,
        quantity,
        cost: this.calculateCost(eventType, quantity),
        billingPeriod: format(new Date(), 'yyyy-MM')
      }
    });

    // Send to Stripe for billing (if metered billing)
    if (this.isMeteredEvent(eventType)) {
      await stripe.subscriptionItems.createUsageRecord(
        subscriptionId,
        {
          quantity: Math.ceil(quantity),
          timestamp: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
          action: 'increment'
        }
      );
    }
  }

  async calculateMonthlyBill(subscriptionId: string): Promise<BillingCalculation> {
    const subscription = await prisma.subscription.findUnique({
      where: { id: subscriptionId },
      include: { usageRecords: true }
    });

    const currentPeriod = format(new Date(), 'yyyy-MM');
    const usage = subscription.usageRecords
      .filter(record => record.billingPeriod === currentPeriod);

    return {
      baseSubscription: subscription.monthlyAmount || 0,
      usageCharges: usage.reduce((sum, record) => sum + record.cost, 0),
      total: baseSubscription + usageCharges
    };
  }
}
```

#### 3. Webhook Handler for Real-time Updates
```typescript
// app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const body = await request.text();
  const signature = request.headers.get('stripe-signature');

  let event: Stripe.Event;
  try {
    event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(body, signature!, process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET!);
  } catch (err) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Invalid signature' }, { status: 400 });
  }

  switch (event.type) {
    case 'customer.subscription.created':
      await handleSubscriptionCreated(event.data.object as Stripe.Subscription);
      break;
    
    case 'invoice.payment_succeeded':
      await handlePaymentSucceeded(event.data.object as Stripe.Invoice);
      break;
    
    case 'invoice.payment_failed':
      await handlePaymentFailed(event.data.object as Stripe.Invoice);
      break;
    
    case 'customer.subscription.updated':
      await handleSubscriptionUpdated(event.data.object as Stripe.Subscription);
      break;
    
    case 'customer.subscription.deleted':
      await handleSubscriptionCanceled(event.data.object as Stripe.Subscription);
      break;
  }

  return NextResponse.json({ received: true });
}
```

### Usage Tracking Integration

#### Document Processing Billing
```typescript
// lib/billing/document-usage.ts
export async function trackDocumentProcessing(
  userId: string,
  document: Document
): Promise<void> {
  const subscription = await getUserSubscription(userId);
  
  // Check limits
  const currentUsage = await getCurrentPeriodUsage(subscription.id);
  const tier = subscription.tier;
  
  if (currentUsage.documentsProcessed >= getTierLimit(tier, 'documents')) {
    // Charge overage or block based on plan
    if (tier === 'FREE') {
      throw new Error('Document limit reached. Please upgrade your plan.');
    } else {
      // Record overage charge
      await recordUsage(subscription.id, 'DOCUMENT_PROCESSED', 1);
    }
  } else {
    // Within limits, just track usage
    await incrementUsageCounter(subscription.id, 'documentsUsed', 1);
  }
  
  // Always track for analytics
  await recordUsage(subscription.id, 'DOCUMENT_UPLOADED', 1);
}
```

#### AI Interaction Billing
```typescript
// lib/billing/ai-usage.ts
export async function trackAIInteraction(
  userId: string,
  interaction: {
    studyId: string;
    chatId: string;
    tokensUsed: number;
    interactionType: 'search' | 'analysis' | 'summary';
  }
): Promise<void> {
  const subscription = await getUserSubscription(userId);
  const cost = calculateAICost(interaction.tokensUsed, interaction.interactionType);
  
  await recordUsage(subscription.id, 'AI_INTERACTION', 1, {
    tokensUsed: interaction.tokensUsed,
    interactionType: interaction.interactionType,
    studyId: interaction.studyId,
    chatId: interaction.chatId,
    cost
  });
  
  // Update subscription usage counter
  await incrementUsageCounter(subscription.id, 'aiInteractionsUsed', 1);
}
```
