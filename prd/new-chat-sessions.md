# PRD: New Chat Sessions Feature

## Overview
Add the ability to create and manage multiple chat sessions within research studies, allowing researchers to organize different lines of inquiry and maintain conversation history.

**Confidence Score: 85%** - High compatibility with existing architecture, clear implementation path

## Problem Statement
Currently, Skate AI supports only one chat per study. Researchers often need multiple conversation threads to explore different aspects of their documents, compare approaches, or maintain organized discussion topics.

## Solution Architecture

### Core Implementation
Based on Vercel AI Chatbot analysis, implement study-scoped multiple chat sessions using:

- **Database Extension**: Add `Chat` model linked to studies
- **URL Structure**: `/study/[studyId]/chat/[chatId]` 
- **Navigation**: Chat header with "New Chat" button and session switcher
- **Session Management**: Auto-generated chat titles, creation timestamps

### Technical Approach
```prisma
model Chat {
  id          String    @id @default(cuid())
  title       String    @default("New Chat")
  studyId     String
  study       Study     @relation(fields: [studyId], references: [id])
  createdAt   DateTime  @default(now())
  messages    Message[]
}
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Database and Core Logic (1-2 weeks)
- Extend Prisma schema with Chat model
- Create chat CRUD API endpoints
- Database migration for existing messages
- Update authentication to include chat ownership

### Phase 2: UI Components and Navigation (2-3 weeks)  
- Chat header with new chat button
- Chat session sidebar for study pages
- Chat switching functionality
- Update existing ChatPanel component

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (1-2 weeks)
- Auto-generated chat titles using AI
- Chat deletion and management
- Export individual chat sessions
- Loading states and error handling

### Phase 4: Polish and Optimization (1 week)
- Performance optimization for multiple chats
- UX refinements based on testing
- Comprehensive error handling
- Documentation and testing

## Integration Points

### With Existing Architecture
- **Study Context**: Chats remain scoped to individual studies
- **User Authentication**: Leverage existing user ownership patterns
- **Document Context**: All chats within study have access to same documents
- **Tool Integration**: Existing search and analysis tools work across all chats

### Database Migration Strategy
- Create Chat records for existing conversations
- Migrate messages to link to new chat records
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition

## Success Metrics
- Researchers can create and switch between multiple chats per study
- No performance degradation with multiple active chats
- 95% of existing functionality continues to work seamlessly
- Reduced bounce rate as users can organize conversations better

## Risk Assessment

### High Confidence Areas (90%+)
- Database schema and API implementation
- Integration with existing study architecture
- UI component development

### Medium Risk Areas (70-85%)
- Database migration complexity for existing data
- URL routing changes and deep linking
- Performance with many chats per study

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement feature flags for gradual rollout
- Comprehensive database migration testing
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Maintain single-chat fallback during transition

## Dependencies
- AI SDK v4.3.19 (current) - no changes needed
- Prisma ORM extension - compatible with existing setup
- React/Next.js routing updates - standard patterns

## Future Enhancements
- Chat templates for common research workflows
- Cross-chat search and reference
- Chat collaboration features
- Advanced organization and tagging

## Conclusion
This feature enhances research workflow organization while leveraging proven patterns from the Vercel AI Chatbot. The high confidence score reflects excellent architectural alignment and clear implementation path.
