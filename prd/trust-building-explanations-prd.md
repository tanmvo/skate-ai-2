## 2. Trust-Building Feature Requirements

### 2.1 Evidence Quantification System

**Requirement**: Provide quantitative evidence strength for all AI claims

**Core Features:**
- **Participant/Source Counting**: "This theme appears in 7 of 12 interviews"
- **Document Coverage**: "Found in 4 different research documents"
- **Frequency Analysis**: "Mentioned 23 times across all sources"
- **Distribution Mapping**: "Consistent across interview types (user interviews: 5, expert interviews: 3)"

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
interface EvidenceStrength {
  sourceCount: number;           // Number of documents containing evidence
  totalSources: number;          // Total documents in study
  mentionFrequency: number;      // Total mentions across all sources
  distributionPattern: {         // How evidence is distributed
    documentsWithEvidence: string[];
    concentrationScore: number;  // 0-1, higher = more concentrated
  };
  searchQuality: {
    averageSimilarity: number;   // Average relevance score
    minSimilarity: number;       // Weakest supporting evidence
    searchTerms: string[];       // Terms that found this evidence
  };
}
```

### 2.2 Confidence Scoring Framework

**Requirement**: Multi-dimensional confidence indicators for insights

**Confidence Dimensions:**
1. **Evidence Strength** (0-100): Quantity and quality of supporting data
2. **Source Reliability** (0-100): Document types and research quality
3. **Cross-Document Consensus** (0-100): Agreement across different sources
4. **Search Completeness** (0-100): How thoroughly documents were searched

**Display Integration:**
- Confidence badges for each major claim
- Color-coded confidence levels (red/yellow/green)
- Hover tooltips explaining confidence calculation
- Overall insight confidence score

**Technical Architecture:**
```typescript
interface InsightConfidence {
  overall: number;              // 0-100 composite confidence score
  dimensions: {
    evidenceStrength: number;   // Quantity/quality of evidence
    sourceReliability: number;  // Source document credibility
    crossDocConsensus: number;  // Agreement across sources
    searchCompleteness: number; // Thoroughness of search
  };
  rationaleBrief: string;       // "High confidence: Strong evidence from 6/8 sources"
  detailedRationale: string;    // Comprehensive explanation
}
```

### 2.3 Methodology Transparency

**Requirement**: Clear explanation of how insights were derived

**Transparency Components:**
- **Search Strategy Explanation**: "Searched all documents using terms: 'user frustration', 'pain points', 'difficulties'"
- **Coverage Analysis**: "Analyzed 8 of 8 documents (100% coverage)"
- **Filtering Criteria**: "Included passages with >70% relevance score"
- **Synthesis Methodology**: "Grouped findings by thematic similarity and frequency"

**User Interface Elements:**
- Expandable "How was this found?" sections
- Search strategy summaries for each insight
- Coverage maps showing which documents contributed
- Methodology footnotes for complex analysis

### 2.4 Uncertainty Communication

**Requirement**: Clear communication when evidence is incomplete or conflicting

**Uncertainty Indicators:**
- **Limited Evidence Warnings**: "Based on 2 of 8 documents - may not be representative"
- **Conflicting Evidence Alerts**: "Mixed findings: positive in 3 sources, negative in 2"
- **Search Limitations**: "No evidence found - may require different search terms"
- **Temporal Disclaimers**: "Based on available documents - recent changes may not be reflected"

---

## 3. Data Derivation Architecture

### 3.1 Enhanced Search Tool Analytics

**Current Enhancement Needs:**
Extend existing `search-tools.ts` with derivation tracking:

```typescript
interface EnhancedSearchResult extends SearchResult {
  metadata: {
    searchTermsUsed: string[];
    documentCoverage: {
      searched: number;
      total: number;
      percentage: number;
    };
    resultQuality: {
      averageSimilarity: number;
      qualityDistribution: number[];
    };
    derivationPath: SearchDerivation[];
  };
}

interface SearchDerivation {
  step: string;                 // "initial_search", "refinement", "validation"
  query: string;               // Search query used
  rationale: string;           // Why this search was performed
  resultsCount: number;        // Results found
  timestamp: number;           // When this step occurred
}
```

### 3.2 Evidence Aggregation Engine

**Purpose**: Track and quantify evidence patterns across searches

**Core Functions:**
- Cross-reference evidence across multiple searches
- Calculate evidence strength based on multiple dimensions
- Identify supporting vs. contradicting evidence patterns
- Generate quantitative evidence summaries

**Implementation:**
```typescript
class EvidenceAggregator {
  // Track evidence from multiple search results
  aggregateEvidence(searchResults: EnhancedSearchResult[]): AggregatedEvidence;
  
  // Calculate confidence based on evidence patterns
  calculateConfidence(evidence: AggregatedEvidence): InsightConfidence;
  
  // Generate human-readable evidence summaries
  generateEvidenceSummary(evidence: AggregatedEvidence): EvidenceSummary;
  
  // Identify potential bias or gaps in evidence
  identifyEvidenceGaps(evidence: AggregatedEvidence): EvidenceGap[];
}
```

### 3.3 Real-time Derivation Tracking

**Integration with Existing System:**
Extend current tool call persistence to include derivation metadata:

```typescript
interface EnhancedToolCall extends PersistedToolCall {
  derivationMetadata: {
    searchStrategy: string;      // High-level approach taken
    evidenceFound: number;       // Pieces of evidence discovered
    sourcesCovered: string[];    // Document IDs searched
