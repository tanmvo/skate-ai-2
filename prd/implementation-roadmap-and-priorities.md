## Recommended Implementation Roadmap

## Phase 1: Foundation and User Experience (Weeks 1-8)
**Goal:** Fix critical UX gaps and establish data-driven development

### 1.1 Missing CRUD Operations (Weeks 1-4)
**Priority: URGENT - Start Immediately**

**Reasoning:**
- **Critical UX Blocker:** Document deletion completely broken (useDocuments hook calls non-existent endpoint)
- **User Frustration:** Cannot rename or manage documents after upload  
- **Technical Debt:** Orphaned files accumulating in storage, increasing costs
- **Foundation:** Required for user satisfaction before any marketing efforts
- **Quick Win:** High impact, low effort, immediate user satisfaction improvement

**Business Impact:**
- Fixes broken functionality blocking user adoption
- Reduces support tickets and user churn
- Prevents storage cost escalation
- Enables confident user acquisition efforts

### 1.2 Analytics and Monitoring (Weeks 3-6)
**Priority: HIGH - Start in parallel with CRUD work**

**Reasoning:**
- **Data-Driven Decisions:** Essential for optimizing all future development
- **Low Cost/High Value:** $0-200/month for comprehensive insights vs $17K+/year alternatives
- **Foundation for Growth:** Required to measure success of all subsequent features
- **Parallel Development:** Can be implemented alongside CRUD operations
