### Integration with Future Auth System
```typescript
// Migration strategy when Auth.js is implemented
async function migrateBetaUserToAuth(betaSignup: BetaSignup) {
  // 1. Create Auth.js account with verified email
  const authUser = await createAuthUser(betaSignup.email);
  
  // 2. Link to User record with beta metadata
  const user = await prisma.user.create({
    data: {
      email: betaSignup.email,
      name: betaSignup.name,
      betaSignupId: betaSignup.id, // Track beta origin
    }
  });
  
  // 3. Update beta status
  await prisma.betaSignup.update({
    where: { id: betaSignup.id },
    data: { 
      status: 'ACTIVATED',
      inviteAcceptedAt: new Date()
    }
  });
}
```
